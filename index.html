        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
          I was born December 22, 1999 in New Hampshire where I spent ~ the
          first 10 years of my life until I moved to central Florida. Since then
          I have began my coding journey at the age of 22 and continue to enjoy
          it more every day!
        </p>
        <p>
          I began using CodeAcademy early 2022 where I started a lesson in C++.
          Seeing the computer spit out "hello world" was the most mind boggling
          thing I've seen and have strived for the feeling ever since! For the
          most part I jumped away from C++ and began my journey into
          Web-Development! My preferred language is PHP, with skills in all that
          surroud Web-Development like HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently a situation at work has opened a new door into Security
          (Thanks Steve) and plan to pursue that alongside my growing skills in
          Web-Development!
